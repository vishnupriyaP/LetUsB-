 * A <code>NewspaperStory</code> is composed of the date the story was
 * published, the name of the newspaper where the story was published, the
 * length the story in words, the broad topic for the story, the specific
 * subject matter of the story, and two lead news makers in the story.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Since all of these elements are present in <code>NewsStory</code>,
 * <code>NewspaperStory</code> is created as a subclass of
 * <code>NewsStory</code>. However, <code>NewspaperStory</code> can implement
 * <code>getLengthInWords</code> because we know the inherent length measurement
 * units for newspaper stories (words), whereas different news stories may use
 * different length units.
