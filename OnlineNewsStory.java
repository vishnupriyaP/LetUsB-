/**
 * Project 3, CS 2334, Section 010, March 8, 2017
 * <P>
 * A <code>OnlineNewsStory</code> is composed of the date snapshot of the story
 * was taken, <b>the part of the day when the snapshot happened,</b> the name of
 * the online news site that published the story, the length the story in words,
 * the broad topic for the story, the specific subject matter of the story, and
 * two lead news makers in the story.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Since most of these elements are present in <code>NewsStory</code>,
 * <code>OnlineNewsStory</code> is created as a subclass of
 * <code>NewsStory</code>. However, <code>OnlineNewsStory</code> can implement
 * <code>getLengthInWords</code> because we know the inherent length measurement
 * units for online news stories (words), whereas different news stories may use
 * different length units. In addition, each <code>OnlineNewsStory</code>
 * includes the part of the day when the snapshot happened (morning or
 * afternoon), which isn't true for all types of <code>NewsStory</code>. For
 * this reason, an additional field (<code>partOfDay</code>) and corresponding
 * accessor and mutator methods are included in <code>OnlineNewsStory</code>.
 * </P>
