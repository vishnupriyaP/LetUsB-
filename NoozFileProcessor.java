/**
 * Project 3, CS 2334, Section 010, March 8, 2017
 * <P>
 * This class provides helper methods to read a Nooz-style data file and turn it
 * into <code>NewsStory</code> and <code>NewsMaker</code> objects.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Note that the field <code>newsMakers</code> and all methods in this class are
 * static because we don't need to make several <code>NoozFileProcessor</code>
 * objects and have them maintain their own lists of news makers. Instead, we
 * simply need a collection of useful methods to create a list and return it to
 * the calling method that will keep track of it.
 * </P>

 * @author Dean Hougen, Jered Little, Vishnupriya Parasaram, Jessica Horner, and Zakary Koskovich

	 * The primary method for reading the Nooz-style data file.

	 * It opens the file, reads through it line by line until it reaches the
	 * end, and closes the file. Each line is passed to <code>processLine</code>
	 * to parse and turn into data that is actually added to the list.
	 * </P>
	 * <P>
	 * In addition to the name of the Nooz-style file to read, this method takes
	 * three maps from brief numeral codes to longer textual descriptions. The
	 * maps are from source code (e.g., "1") to source name (e.g., "New York
	 * Times"), from topic code (e.g., "1") to topic description (e.g.,
	 * "Government Agencies/Legislatures"), and from subject matter code (e.g.,
	 * "2") to subject matter description (e.g., "Immigration debate"). Note
	 * that while all of these maps use numerals as keys, these are represented
	 * as <code>String</code> objects rather than <code>Integer</code> objects.

	 * Note that this program doesn't attempt to deal with I/O errors. This is
	 * allowable at this point to keep this project relatively simple and

	 * be refined in the future.
