/**
 * Project 3, CS 2334, Section 010, March 8, 2017
 * <P>
 * A <code>TVNewsStory</code> is composed of the date the story was broadcast,
 * <b>the part of the day when the broadcast happened,</b> the name of the TV
 * news show that broadcast the story, the length the story in seconds, the
 * broad topic for the story, the specific subject matter of the story, and two
 * lead news makers in the story.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Since most of these elements are present in <code>NewsStory</code>,
 * <code>TVNewsStory</code> is created as a subclass of <code>NewsStory</code>.
 * However, <code>TVNewsStory</code> can implement <code>getLengthInWords</code>
 * because we know the inherent length measurement units for TV news stories
 * (seconds), whereas different news stories may use different length units.
 * <b>In addition, each <code>TVNewsStory</code> includes the part of the day
 * when the broadcast happened (morning, afternoon, evening, or late night),
 * which isn't true for all types of <code>NewsStory</code>. For this reason, an
 * additional field (<code>partOfDay</code>) and a corresponding accessor method
 * (<code>getPartOfDay()</code>) is included in <code>TVNewsStory</code>.</b>
 * </P>
